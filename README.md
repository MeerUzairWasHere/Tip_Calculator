# Tip-Calculator

This Git repository contains code for a tip calculator, which was created as part of an exercise by Clever Programmer on YouTube. The tip calculator is a web application that helps users quickly calculate the amount of tip they should leave based on the total bill amount and desired tip percentage. The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be easily customized to meet specific needs. This repository provides a convenient way for developers to access the code and collaborate on further improvements.
